# Asynchronous Task Implementation in Android

## Technologies Used:
**1. Programming Language: Java** - Java is the primary programming language used for Android app development. It provides the foundation for creating the business logic and handling various operations, including AsyncTask implementation. 

**2. Framework:** Android SDK - The Android Software Development Kit (SDK) is a collection of tools and libraries provided by Google for developing Android applications. It includes essential components like activities, views, and services, enabling the creation of interactive and feature-rich Android apps.  

**3. Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Android Studio** - Android Studio is the official IDE for Android app development. It provides a user-friendly interface, advanced code editing features, a layout editor, and seamless integration with the Android SDK and device emulators.

**4. Hardware Requirements:** \
   &emsp; **- Processor:** Any processor with a speed of 1.60GHz or higher. \
   &emsp;**- RAM:** A minimum of 6.00 GB is required for smooth development and testing. \
   &emsp;**- Hard Disk:** At least 20 GB of free space is recommended for installing Android Studio and its associated components. \
   &emsp;**- Input Device:** A keyboard is required for coding and text input. \
   &emsp;**- Output Device:** Either a connected Android mobile device or an Android Emulator (Pixel 3a API 27) is used for testing the application. 

**5. XML (Extensible Markup Language):** XML is used for defining the user interface layout of the Android activity. The "activity_main.xml" file contains the layout for the main activity, including the TextView and buttons.

**6. Android Widgets: TextView, Button** - These are Android UI elements used to display text and handle user interactions, respectively. In the project, a TextView is used to display a message, and Buttons are used to trigger the AsyncTask and hide the TextView.

**7. AsyncTask Class:** AsyncTask is an Android class that facilitates background processing and UI synchronization. It allows for the execution of tasks in a separate thread from the main UI thread and is utilized for short operations that won't block the UI.

**8. Toast:** Android Toast is a small pop-up message used to display brief information to the user. In this project, Toast is used to show a message when the AsyncTask starts.

Overall, the project leverages Java and the Android SDK, with Android Studio as the development environment. It demonstrates the effective use of AsyncTask to perform background operations and update the UI accordingly, enhancing the user experience in the Android application.
